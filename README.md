# Templ Blog
Honestly, there's not much to see here yet. I thought I'd learn some `go` for
fun and so I'm building a little website using [templ](https://templ.guide/).

Currently, this site isn't being hosted anywhere. If I do anything interesting with it, I might go host it.

## Build and Run
I created a little build script named `b`. It regenerates the `templ` templates
and runs the server. That's it.

I have a shell alias that aliases `b` to `./b` so that I can just type `b` in
my terminal.
